# To do

List of things that need additional scrutiny. Send PRs and ideas if you have attacked IBM Cloud before!

## General things

1. Update the github documentation to make it easily readable for anyone wanting to get started with IBM Cloud pentesting
2. Continue documenting misconfigurations, potential weaknesses, insecure defaults, publicly accessible DNS/data etc. plus the To-Dos listed in the repo
3. Build reliable tooling for some of the misconfiguration detection that can be automated
4. Explore the security services available within IBM Cloud and see what they do not detect, and if their current detection capabilities can be abused.
5. Explore IAM, users, roles and privilege abuses.

## OSINT External

1. Look at managed services within IBM and see if public IP ranges match AS36351
2. Create sublists of IP ranges reserved for managed services (IPs that will never become floating IPs)
3. What's visible for these IP sublists via public discovery, are there public databases, containers etc.?
4. For the IPs already obtained, sort them based on IBM Cloud supported regions

## IBM Cloud Storage

1. Access policies for IBM Cloud Storage, for buckets and objects
2. Check for volume and snapshot storage and their permissions (equivalent in IBM Cloud)

## IBM Cloud shell

1. The IBM Cloud shell appears to have internal network access, capabilities and setuid binaries that could potentially be used to gain root and escape the container.

## IBM Cloud Functions

1. Check if any of the current container capabilities can be abused to attempt to escape of make network calls
2. Current capabilities: `cap_chown`, `cap_dac_override`, `cap_fowner`, `cap_setgid`, `cap_setuid`, `cap_audit_write`
3. Research the OpenWhisk REST API interface to find potential issues that can be abused
4. Test other known container escape techniques

### IBM Cloud Databases

1. Profile the external footprint of the other managed databases. This includes
    - Domain names
    - Header information and unique signatures
    - Error messages
2. Identify credential requirements, which of them allow unauthenticated access by default?
