# Pentesting IBM Cloud

This repo contains observations and findings that are useful to attackers looking to target IBM Cloud or apps and services being run by customers who use the IBM Cloud.

This repository and the research was 1st presented at [fwd:cloudsec 2021](https://fwdcloudsec.org/speakers.html#pentesting-ibm-cloud). The slides for the presentation are listed below.
